# API Deserialization Test Automation

Welcome to the API Deserialization test automation project! This project demonstrates how to deserialize a response body into a Java object using RestAssured in Java. The code sends a PUT request to a specified URL with a path parameter, validates the response, and performs assertions on the returned data by deserializing it into a Java object.

## Project Description

This code demonstrates how to deserialize a response body into a Java object using RestAssured in Java. It utilizes RestAssured to send a PUT request to the specified URL with a path parameter, and then deserializes the response body into a Java object. The code performs assertions on the returned data by comparing it to expected data stored in a test data repository.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including RestAssured.

2. Compile and run the `API_Deserialization` class.

3. The code sends a PUT request to the specified URL with the path parameter, validates the response, and performs assertions on the returned data by deserializing it into a Java object.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **RestAssured**: A Java library that simplifies REST API testing.

To install the dependencies, you can use a build tool such as Maven or Gradle to manage them, or you can install them manually.

## Scenario

### Test Scenario

## Test Scenario: API Deserialization

### Objective:
To verify that the response body can be successfully deserialized into a Java object and perform assertions on the returned data.

### Preconditions:
- Ensure that the RestAssured library is properly installed and configured.
- Ensure that the base URL repository and test data repository are correctly defined.

### Test Steps:
1. **Create URL and Request Body:**
    - Define the base URL and path parameter for the API request.
    - Create the request body for the PUT request.

2. **Send PUT Request:**
    - Send a PUT request to the specified URL with the path parameter and request body.

3. **Deserialize Response:**
    - Deserialize the response body into a Java object.

4. **Perform Assertions:**
    - Perform assertions on the returned data by comparing it to expected data stored in the test data repository.

### Expected Results:
- The PUT request should be sent successfully, and the response should have the expected status code.
- The response body should be successfully deserialized into a Java object.
- Assertions should pass, confirming that the returned data matches the expected data.

### Notes:
- Monitor the execution of the test to ensure that the response body is correctly deserialized and that assertions are passing as expected.
- Review the console output and any log files generated by the test for debugging purposes.
